Foundry is an interactive, real-time Javascript interface that allows flash teams to be assembled by anyone and tracked in real time. A flash team is a "startup" assembled for just an afternoon/day/week to build something eg. a full-blown 3d animation film, or an entire mobile app. With Foundry, members of a flash team can seamlessly collaborate with other members, handing off assets, discussing questions and sharing important updates. Real time expert crowdsourcing at its best.
