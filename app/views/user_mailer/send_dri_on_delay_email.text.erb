Flash Teams: <%= @event_name %> is running late
===============================================
 
Dear <%= @dri_role %>,

Foundry must inform you that <%= @event_name %> is running late. <%= link_to 'Please fill out this form', @url %> to give other team members an estimate of how long it takes to finish the delayed task. If we do not hear back from you in <%= @minutes %> minutes, we will notify other team members anyway.
